        <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup <br />
        language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br />
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
        assisted
        <br />by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
        scripting<br />
        languages such as JavaScript

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from<br />
          a web server or from local storage and render the<br />
          documents into multimedia web pages. HTML<br />
          describes the structure of a web page semantically<br />
          and originally included cues for its appearance.

          HTML can embed programs written in a scripting<br />
          language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior<br />
          and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines <br />the look
          and layout of content. The World Wide Web<br />
          Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML <br />and current
          maintainer of the CSS standards, has<br />
          encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational <br />HTML
          since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5,<br />
          is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element,<br />
          together with JavaScript.

      <pre>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
      used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.
